# Binary-Prediction-of-Smoker-Status-using-Bio-Signals

Overview

This repository contains machine learning models developed to predict the smoking status of individuals based on various bio-signals. Smoking has significant adverse effects on health, and accurate identification of smoking status using bio-signals can aid in targeted interventions for smoking cessation.

Dataset Description

The dataset used for model development comprises several bio-signals and demographic information:

age: Grouped in 5-year intervals

height (cm): Height of the individual

weight (kg): Body weight of the individual

waist (cm): Waist circumference length

eyesight (left/right): Eyesight measurements

hearing (left/right): Hearing measurements

systolic: Systolic blood pressure

relaxation: Diastolic blood pressure

fasting blood sugar: Blood sugar levels after fasting

Cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), triglyceride: Various cholesterol measurements

hemoglobin: Blood hemoglobin levels

Urine protein: Presence of protein in urine

serum creatinine: Serum creatinine levels

AST, ALT, Gtp: Different enzyme types

dental caries: Dental health condition

smoking: Target variable indicating smoking status


Model Development

The predictive model was created using machine learning techniques. Various algorithms were explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting smoking status based on the provided bio-signals. The model performance was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
